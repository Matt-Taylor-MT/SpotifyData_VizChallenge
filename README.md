# SpotifyData_VizChallenge
Spotify data generation for october data viz challenge

To run code ensure that all relevant packages have been installed.

You will need to create an App API using https://developer.spotify.com/

Create an app_creds.py file and include your spotify using the following lines:
username = ''
client_id =''
client_secret = ''

NB: username is your spotify username, client_id and client_secret come from your app api

The python notebook uses the Spotipy to pull additional track, artist and audio features.
You can do much more with it. Check out https://spotipy.readthedocs.io/en/2.16.0/ and https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/ for more details.

Enjoy!
